To find out, Wendy Zukerman speaks to Dr Kieron Rooney, Prof. Sandra Capra, Prof. Peter Clifton, Prof. Bob Boakes as well as That Sugar Film's Damon Gameau. \n\nTo be clear, Damon Gameau from 'That Sugar Film' and the 'I Quit Sugar' team have different approaches to the sugar-free diet.  \n\nMore reading:\nClaims from I Quit Sugar: https://iquitsugar.com/eleven-ways-sugar-messes-with-your-health/\n\n'That Sugar Film':  http://thatsugarfilm.com\n\nBMC Biology Q and A on Fructose http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/10/42\n\nBMJ Dietary sugars and body weight: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies  http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e7492",
