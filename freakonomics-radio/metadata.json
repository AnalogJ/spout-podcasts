  "description":"In their books \"Freakonomics\" and \"SuperFreakonomics,\" Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner explore \"the hidden side of everything,\" with stories about cheating schoolteachers, self-dealing real-estate agents, and crack-selling mama’s boys. The Freakonomics Radio podcast, hosted by Dubner, carries on that tradition with weekly episodes. Prepare to be enlightened, engaged, perhaps enraged, and definitely surprised.© WNYC and Dubner Productions"
