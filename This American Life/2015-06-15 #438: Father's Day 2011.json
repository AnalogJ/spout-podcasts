  "description": "Yes yes yes you've heard it all before, when it comes to stories of fathers and their children.  There's the story of the kid who idolizes his dad, but then learns something and becomes disappointed.  Or the opposite story, where the kid gives up on his dad when he's still young, and then much later comes to have a grudging respect.  This week for fathers day: surprising stories of fathers trying to be good dads.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/talpodcast/~4/Vjpy9CzadEM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",
